# Challenge - JS DOM Assignment

**Description**: I took a javascript quiz that required us to change the color of specific boxes based on user's input of box number and color to change it to and have the ability to reset every box on button click. I made use of the .includes method to check if the user's color input is included in our array of accepted colors meaning that only red, blue, purple, brown, and yellow will be accepted and nothing else. i also messed around with grabbing the id of boxes by interpolating the user's input for box number in place of where the individual numbers next to the word box would go for the id and using that to be able to change the background color of the boxes accordingly.

### Peer Review

**Reviewer**:  Alexander Soria

**Reviewer Notes**:  Nice job! Everything works as intended. Nice job setting toLowerCase for the color input. One minor recommendation would be to add a value limit of 1 for the box selection, since the only options are 1-8, but it's not entirely necessary.
